## Options

### `windowMs`

> `number`

Time frame for which requests are checked/remembered. Also used in the
`Retry-After` header when the limit is reached.

Note: with stores that do not implement the `init` function (see the table in
the [`stores` section below](#stores)), you may need to configure this value
twice, once here and once on the store. In some cases the units also differ
(e.g. seconds vs miliseconds).

Defaults to `60000` ms (= 1 minute).

### `max`

> `number | function`

The maximum number of connections to allow during the `window` before rate
limiting the client.

Can be the limit itself as a number or a (sync/async) function that accepts the
Express `request` and `response` objects and then returns a number.

Defaults to `5`. Set it to `0` to disable the rate limiter.

An example of using a function:

```ts
const isPremium = async (user) => {
	// ...
}
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	max: async (request, response) => {
		if (await isPremium(request.user)) return 10
		else return 5
	},
})
```

### `message`

> `any`

The response body to send back when a client is rate limited.

May be a `string`, JSON object, or any other value that Express's
[response.send](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#response.send) method
supports.

Defaults to `'Too many requests, please try again later.'`

### `statusCode`

> `number`

The HTTP status code to send back when a client is rate limited.

Defaults to `429` (HTTP 429 Too Many Requests - RFC 6585).

### `legacyHeaders`

> `boolean`

Whether to send the legacy rate limit headers for the limit
(`X-RateLimit-Limit`), current usage (`X-RateLimit-Remaining`) and reset time
(if the store provides it) (`X-RateLimit-Reset`) on all responses. If set to
`true`, the middleware also sends the `Retry-After` header on all blocked
requests.

Defaults to `true` (for backward compatibility).

> Renamed in `6.x` from `headers` to `legacyHeaders`.
### `standardHeaders`

> `boolean`

Whether to enable support for headers conforming to the
[ratelimit standardization draft](https://github.com/ietf-wg-httpapi/ratelimit-headers/blob/main/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers.md)
adopted by the IETF (`RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, and, if the store
supports it, `RateLimit-Reset`). If set to `true`, the middleware also sends the
`Retry-After` header on all blocked requests. May be used in conjunction with,
or instead of the `legacyHeaders` option.

Defaults to `false` (for backward compatibility, but its use is recommended).

> Renamed in `6.x` from `draft_polli_ratelimit_headers` to `standardHeaders`.

### `requestPropertyName`

> `string`

The name of the property on the Express `request` object to store the rate limit
info.

Defaults to `'rateLimit'`.

### `skipFailedRequests`

> `boolean`

When set to `true`, failed requests won't be counted. Request considered failed
when the `requestWasSuccessful` option returns `false`. By default, this means
requests fail when:

- the response status >= 400
- the request was cancelled before last chunk of data was sent (response `close`
  event triggered)
- the response `error` event was triggered by response

(Technically they are counted and then un-counted, so a large number of slow
requests all at once could still trigger a rate-limit. This may be fixed in a
future release. PRs welcome!)

Defaults to `false`.

### `skipSuccessfulRequests`

> `boolean`

If `true`, the library will (by default) skip all requests that are considered
'failed' by the `requestWasSuccessful` function. By default, this means requests
succeed when the response status code < 400.

(Technically they are counted and then un-counted, so a large number of slow
requests all at once could still trigger a rate-limit. This may be fixed in a
future release. PRs welcome!)

Defaults to `false`.

### `keyGenerator`

> `function`

Method to generate custom identifiers for clients.

Should be a (sync/async) function that accepts the Express `request` and
`response` objects and then returns a string.

By default, the client's IP address is used:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	keyGenerator: (request, response) => request.ip,
})
```

### `handler`

> `function`

Express request handler that sends back a response when a client is
rate-limited.

By default, sends back the `statusCode` and `message` set via the options:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	handler: (request, response, next, options) =>
		response.status(options.statusCode).send(options.message),
})
```

### ~`onLimitReached`~

> ~`function`~

~A (sync/async) function that accepts the Express `request` and `response`
objects that is called when a client has reached their rate limit, and will be
rate limited on their next request.~

This method was
[deprecated in v6](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit/releases/v6.0.0) -
Please use a custom `handler` that checks the number of hits instead.

### `skip`

> `function`

Function to determine whether or not this request counts towards a client's
quota. Should be a (sync/async) function that accepts the Express `request` and
`response` objects and then returns `true` or `false`.

Could also act as an allowlist for certain keys:

```ts
const allowlist = ['192.168.0.56', '192.168.0.21']
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	skip: (request, response) => allowlist.includes(request.ip),
})
```

By default, it skips no requests:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	skip: (request, response) => false,
})
```

### `requestWasSuccessful`

> `function`

Method to determine whether or not the request counts as 'succesful'. Used when
either `skipSuccessfulRequests` or `skipFailedRequests` is set to true. Should
be a (sync/async) function that accepts the Express `request` and `response`
objects and then returns `true` or `false`.

By default, requests with a response status code less than 400 are considered
successful:

```ts
const limiter = rateLimit({
	// ...
	requestWasSuccessful: (request, response) => response.statusCode < 400,
})
```

### `store`

> `Store`

The `Store` to use to store the hit count for each client.

By default, the [`memory-store`](source/memory-store.ts) is used.

Here is a list of external stores:

| Name                                                                                   | Description                                                                                           | Legacy/Modern       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [`memory-store`](source/memory-store.ts)                                               | _(default)_ Simple in-memory option. Does not share state when app has multiple processes or servers. | Modern as of v6.0.0 |
| [`rate-limit-redis`](https://npmjs.com/package/rate-limit-redis)                       | A [Redis](http://redis.io/)-backed store, more suitable for large or demanding deployments.           | Modern as of v3.0.0 |
| [`rate-limit-memcached`](https://npmjs.org/package/rate-limit-memcached)               | A [Memcached](https://memcached.org/)-backed store.                                                   | Legacy              |
| [`rate-limit-mongo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rate-limit-mongo)                   | A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)-backed store.                                                   | Legacy              |
| [`precise-memory-rate-limit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/precise-memory-rate-limit) | A memory store similar to the built-in one, except that it stores a distinct timestamp for each key.  | Legacy              |

Take a look at
[this guide](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit/wiki/Creating-Your-Own-Store)
if you wish to create your own store.

## Request API

A `request.rateLimit` property is added to all requests with the `limit`,
`current`, and `remaining` number of requests and, if the store provides it, a
`resetTime` Date object. These may be used in your application code to take
additional actions or inform the user of their status.

The property name can be configured with the configuration option
`requestPropertyName`.

## Instance API

### `resetKey(key)`

Resets the rate limiting for a given key. An example use case is to allow users
to complete a captcha or whatever to reset their rate limit, then call this
method.
