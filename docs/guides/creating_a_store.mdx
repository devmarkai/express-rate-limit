### Overview

A custom store will internally track how many hits each identifier (IP address) has received and automatically reduce that hit count as time elapses.

A `Store` **must** have the `increment`, `decrement`, and `resetKey` public methods. It may optionally have the `init` and `resetAll` public methods (for backwards compatibility with express-rate-limit versions prior to 6.0.0), as well as a `constructor` and any number of private methods.

The `increment` method is the primary interface between the middleware and the store. It adds 1 to the internal count for a key and returns an object consisting of the new internal count (`totalHits`) and the time that the count will reach 0 (`resetTime`).

The `decrement` method is used only to 'uncount' requests when one or both of the `skipSuccessfulRequests` or `skipFailedRequests` options are enabled.

The `init` method allows the store to set itself up using the options passed to the middleware. The store can get the `windowMs` option from this method.

In `package.json`, set `"peerDependencies": { "express-rate-limit": ">=6" }` if the store does not include `incr()`, or `>=2.3.0` if the store does have the `incr()` method. Also put `express-rate-limit` in the `devDependencies` with a more specific version for local testing and typescript definitions.

Examples:

- [TypeScript](#typescript)
- [JavaScript](#javascript)

### TypeScript

To create your own store in TypeScript, you must implement the `Store` interface provided by the library. Here is an example to get you started:

```ts
import rateLimit, {
	Store,
	Options,
	IncrementResponse,
} from 'express-rate-limit'

/**
 * A `Store` that stores the hit count for each client.
 *
 * @public
 */
class SomeStore implements Store {
	/**
	 * Some store-specific parameter.
	 */
	customParam!: string

	/**
	 * The duration of time before which all hit counts are reset (in milliseconds).
	 */
	windowMs!: number

	/**
	 * @constructor for `SomeStore`. Only required if the user needs to pass
	 * some store specific parameters. For example, in a Mongo Store, the user will
	 * need to pass the URI, username and password for the Mongo database.
	 *
	 * @param customParam {string} - Some store-specific parameter.
	 */
	constructor(customParam: string) {
		this.customParam = customParam
	}

	/**
	 * Method that actually initializes the store. Must be synchronous.
	 *
	 * This method is optional, it will be called only if it exists.
	 *
	 * @param options {Options} - The options used to setup express-rate-limit.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	init(options: Options): void {
		this.windowMs = options.windowMs
		// ...
	}

	/**
	 * Method to increment a client's hit counter.
	 *
	 * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
	 *
	 * @returns {IncrementResponse} - The number of hits and reset time for that client.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	async increment(key: string): Promise<IncrementResponse> {
		// ...
		return {
			totalHits,
			resetTime,
		}
	}

	/**
	 * Method to decrement a client's hit counter.
	 *
	 * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	async decrement(key: string): Promise<void> {
		// ...
	}

	/**
	 * Method to reset a client's hit counter.
	 *
	 * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	async resetKey(key: string): Promise<void> {
		// ...
	}

	/**
	 * Method to reset everyone's hit counter.
	 *
	 * This method is optional, it is never called by express-rate-limit.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	async resetAll(): Promise<void> {
		// ...
	}
}

// Export the store so others can use it
export default SomeStore
```

You can then use the store as follows:

```ts
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'
import SomeStore from './some-store.js'

const limiter = rateLimit({
	store: new SomeStore(),
})
```

### JavaScript

```js
/**
 * A `Store` that stores the hit count for each client.
 *
 * @public
 */
class SomeStore {
	/**
	 * @constructor for `SomeStore`. Only required if the user needs to pass
	 * some store specific parameters. For example, in a Mongo Store, the user will
	 * need to pass the URI, username and password for the Mongo database.
	 *
	 * @param customParam {string} - Some store-specific parameter.
	 */
	 constructor(customParam) {
	   this.customParam = customParam
	 }

	/**
	 * Method that actually initializes the store. Must be synchronous.
	 *
	 * This method is optional, it will be called only if it exists.
	 *
	 * @param options {Options} - The options used to setup express-rate-limit.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	 init(options) {
	   this.windowMs = options.windowMs
	 }

	/**
	 * Method to increment a client's hit counter.
	 *
	 * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
	 *
	 * @returns {IncrementResponse} - The number of hits and reset time for that client.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	 async increment(key) {
	   // ...

	   return {
	     totalHits, // A positive integer
	     resetTime, // A JS `Date` object
	   }
	 }

	/**
	 * Method to decrement a client's hit counter.
	 *
	 * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	 async decrement(key) {
	   // ...
	 }

	/**
	 * Method to reset a client's hit counter.
	 *
	 * @param key {string} - The identifier for a client.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	 async resetKey(key) {
	   // ...
	 }

	/**
	 * Method to reset everyone's hit counter.
	 *
	 * This method is optional, it is never called by express-rate-limit.
	 *
	 * @public
	 */
	 async resetAll() {
	   // ...
	 }
}

// Export the store so others can use it
// ...via the CommonJS style
module.exports = SomeStore
// ...or the ES Module style
export default SomeStore
```

You can then use the store as follows:

```ts
// Use `const ... = require('...')` instead if you are using CommonJS
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'
import SomeStore from './some-store.js'

const limiter = rateLimit({
	store: new SomeStore(),
})
```
