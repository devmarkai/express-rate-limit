# express-rate-limit
Express-rate-limit is a basic rate-limiting middleware for [Express](http://expressjs.com/), used to
limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.
Plays nice with
[express-slow-down](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-slow-down). 

## Use Cases

### Abuse Prevention

The default `MemoryStore` is probably fine.

### API Rate Limit Enforcement

The default `MemoryStore` stores the hit counts for clients in memory, and is
thus unsuitable for use when running multiple servers or processes.

If you have multiple processes on a single server (via the
[node:cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module), the
[`cluster-memory-store`](https://npmjs.com/package/@express-rate-limit/cluster-memory-store)
will keep them all in sync without needing an external data store.

If you have multiple servers, or want to maintain state across app restarts, use
an external data store such as
[redis](https://npmjs.com/package/rate-limit-redis),
[memcached](https://npmjs.org/package/rate-limit-memcached), [etc.](#store).

### Alternate Rate Limiters

This module was designed to only handle the basics and didn't even support
external stores initially. These other options all are excellent pieces of
software and may be more appropriate for some situations:

- [`rate-limiter-flexible`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rate-limiter-flexible)
- [`express-brute`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-brute)
- [`rate-limiter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-limiter)
